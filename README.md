# [WIP] Base Web Project
A starting point for HTML5 projects.

Includes a basic index.html and the LESS JavaScript library,
for help creating CSS stylesheets more comfortably.

IMPORTANT: Because of the security restrictions of the
web browser, you surely will get errors opening the web pages
locally (because of the inclusion of LESS).

You will then need loading the web project into a web server.
